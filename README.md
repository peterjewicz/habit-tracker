# habit-tracker

Habit tracker app - TODO bring in mobile hooks

## Overview

Simple IOS/Android App for tracking daily goals. May make ability to create weekly/monthly/yearly in the future
but initial release will just be daily goals.

## Development

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein fig:build

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

	lein clean

To create a production build run:

	lein clean
	lein fig:min
